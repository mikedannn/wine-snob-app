# WineSnob

### Phase 4 Rails/React Project 

This web application was created to allow users to come together over a shared love of tasting and reviewing wines. The user is able to save wines they have tried and look through both their own reviews and the reviews others have left.

### Application Features

* Gives the user the ability to sign up for an account or log in to an existing account with a valid username and secure password
* User can `Add New Review` and `Add New Wine` if they cannot find the wine they are looking for 
* After submitting a new review, the user is directed to that wine's show page where reviews are listed below
* `Edit` or `Delete` any reviews created by the current user
* Safely `Logout` of the application using the button at the top right corner of the page

## Using the App


The user is able to use the Login Form upon opening the application.
